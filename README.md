This is my attempt to create a static content site generator for use in a range of personal projects. It's written in 
ReactJS and uses README and JSON files to create posts and pages. I'm hoping I can make it versatile
enough that I can use it across a range of different projects. The main use case for this project is to
power GitHub Page sites. I imagine it could be used in other settings too as under the hood it's just ReactJS.
